# AFFE

`AFFE` is short for: 
>>**A**nother  
>>**F**ramework   
>>**F**or   
>>**E**xperiments.  

There are _many_ experimental frameworks out there (hence the `A` in `AFFE`). `AFFE` distinguishes itself because it focuses on being _modular_ and _lightweight_.

## Description

In a nutshell, `AFFE` is a _modular_ and _lightweight_ framework. 
You import it as a python package, and you get a toolbox that alleviates common technical tasks that pop up when scaling your experiments.
Examples of such tasks include proper logging, or **defining composite experiments** (called _workflows_ in `AFFE`). 

These are tasks that are not necessarily _hard_ to do, but if you want to do them _right_, these things have a tendency of spiralling out of control.
Therefore, in developing `AFFE`, the idea was to get those right _once and for all_.
